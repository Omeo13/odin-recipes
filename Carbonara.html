    <p>
      Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish made with eggs, cheese,
      pancetta, and pepper.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's creamy, rich, and incredibly satisfying. The key to a perfect
      carbonara is to mix the hot pasta with the egg mixture quickly to create a
      silky sauce without scrambling the eggs.
