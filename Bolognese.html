    <p>
      Bolognese sauce, or rag√π alla Bolognese, is a traditional Italian
      meat-based sauce originating from Bologna. It's typically served with
      pasta, such as tagliatelle, and is known for its rich flavor and hearty
      texture.The sauce is made with ground meat, tomatoes, onions, carrots, and
      a variety of herbs and spices. It's a comforting dish that's perfect for
      family meals or special occasions. The key to a great Bolognese is to
      simmer it slowly, allowing the flavors to meld together beautifully.
